Hello! My name is Duman and i'm sophomore. This repository contains my project for back-end course.
Project about food ordering. We have some kind of menu in my website and also have the page for sending feedback.
In sending feedback page i also added file uploading ability. This feedback will be sent to email. It means i also have email sending feature.
In my project i have three tables. First one for new customers. Second one for already existing shoppers. And the last table for saving feedbacks.
Here one customer can send many feedbacks(one-to-many). Then one shopper can send many feedbacks(one-to-many)
